Version 0.9.8 (beta), released 2012-10-16
  Enhancements:
  - Add support for pushdown of IN and NOT IN clauses in WHERE conditions.
    As suggested by Wang Dong.

  Bugfixes:
  - Add check to make sure that character string data are properly encoded.
    This is necessary because Oracle does not check this properly.
    Per report from David E. Wheeler.

Version 0.9.7 (beta), released 2012-09-07
  Bugfixes:
  - Avoid failure to describe synonyms under certain conditions.
    ATTENTION: This constitutes a compatibility break: table and schema names
    now have to be exactly as they are in Oracle's catalogs, i.e. without
    double quotes and normally in uppercase.
    Per report from Bry Lo.
  - Add paths to Makefile so that we can build with Instant Client RPMs.
    Noticed by Andrew Theaker.
  - Fix a memory corruption bug that can lead to crashes, errors and
    wrong results.
  - Improve bad performance of "SELECT count(*)" on foreign tables.
    This is a simple workaround for the (not yet confirmed)
    Oracle bug 14562530.

Version 0.9.6 (beta), released 2012-06-25
  Enhancements:
  - Support Oracle types LONG and LONG RAW.
    Introduce table option "max_long" (default 32767) to set the maximal
    length of such columns.

  Bugfixes:
  - Fix a bug that causes a server crash when the PostgreSQL session is
    terminated if the only statements involving oracle_fdw during that
    session were CREATE statements.
    Per report from Bry Lo.

Version 0.9.5 (beta), released 2012-05-11
  Enhancements:
  - Support ANALYZE on foreign tables (from PostgreSQL 9.2 on).

  Bugfixes:
  - Fix a bug that leads to warnings and sometimes bad results if system
    columns of the foreign table are referenced.
  - Fix wrong column width estimates of plan_costs=on.

Version 0.9.4 (beta), released 2012-03-19
  Enhancements:
  - Support the new foreign data wrapper API introduced in 9.2.
    In PostgreSQL 9.2 and above, WHERE conditions that get pushed down to
    Oracle will not be checked a second time.
  - Improve error messages for errors during conversion of Oracle data
    so that the problem can be diagnosed.

  Bugfixes:
  - Fix uninitialized value that caused intermittent server crashes.
    Per report from Bruno Voigt.
  - Rework the handling of errors and transactions.  Now an error should not
    be able to cause an Oracle transaction to be left open.  This also fixes
    a bug introduced in 0.9.3 that prevented Oracle errors from being
    reported as DETAIL message.  Also, all foreign scans in one local query
    will now be executed within one Oracle transaction if they belong to
    the same Oracle session.
  - Rework memory management to exclude memory leaks under all circumstances.

Version 0.9.3 (beta), released 2012-02-07
  Enhancements:
  - Add support for PostgreSQL data type "uuid".

  Bugfixes:
  - After an error message, calls to the foreign server result in this error:
      error connecting to Oracle: OCITransStart failed to start a transaction
      ORA-01453: SET TRANSACTION must be first statement of transaction
    The problem is that the previous transaction was not closed.
    This used to go unnoticed, the problem now becomes manifest because we
    explicitly start a serializable transaction.
    Per reports from Keith Fiske and Bruno Voigt.

Version 0.9.2 (beta), released 2011-12-30
  Bugfixes:
  - Fix handling of Oracle BFILE columns.  This was totally broken; attempts
    to select such columns resulted in the error message
    'ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected %s got %s'.
    Bug report and patch by Dominique Legendre.
  - Use a serializable transaction in Oracle to make sure that consistent
    data are retrieved during a rescan.

Version 0.9.1 (beta), released 2011-09-14
  Bugfixes:
  - Fix incorrect use of an automatic variable for binding timestamp parameters
    in Oracle.
  - Remove unnecessary lvalue casts.
    These violate the C standard and cause errors on gcc 4.
    Per report from Dominique Legendre.
  - Fix lack of support for dropped columns in foreign table.
    oracle_fdw incorrectly assumed that the n-th PostgreSQL column corresponds
    to the n-th Oracle column.  This leads to confusion in the presence of
    dropped columns, which retain an entry in pg_attribute.
    Per report from Dominique Legendre.
  - Fix typo that caused wrong and negative sizes being assumed for longer
    Oracle columns.  This led to palloc() errors and Oracle fetch errors.
    Per report from Dominique Legendre.

Version 0.9 (beta), released 2011-08-25
