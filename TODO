This is a list of things that should be done.
Help is welcome!

Support parameterized paths
---------------------------

If the ForeignScan is the inner loop of a nested loop join, try to create
parameterized paths.
Support for Parameterized paths exists since PostgreSQL 9.2.

Support join pushdown
---------------------

Try to push down joins from PostgreSQL 9.5 on.
